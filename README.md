# HypeBot
A Discord bot for managing events. Uses [Serenity](https://github.com/serenity-rs/serenity) for the bot framework
and [Diesel](http://diesel.rs/) as an ORM.

## Usage
Creating an event can be done using the `create` command.
```
~create "Test Event" "5:35PM 2020-05-17" "A very cool test event!" "Cool Place"
```

This creates a draft event that the user can then review:

A user can then use the `confirm` command to create the event and publish it:

Users who react with âœ… will then be sent reminders about the event as private message.
